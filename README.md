# Typing Test Application

**Description:**
The Typing Test Application is a simple typing speed and accuracy test tool implemented using Python with Tkinter and ttkthemes. This application helps users improve their typing speed and accuracy by typing out randomly shuffled paragraphs within a given time frame. It calculates the words per minute (WPM) and accuracy based on the typed input.

**Features:**
- **Real-time typing timer:** Counts down from 60 seconds, displaying the elapsed and remaining time.
- **Word per minute (WPM) calculation:** Calculates the number of correct words typed per minute.
- **Accuracy calculation:** Displays the typing accuracy as a percentage based on the number of correctly typed words versus the total words in the paragraph.
- **Multithreading support:** Runs the timer and word counting functions concurrently for a smooth user experience.
- **Themed UI:** Includes a visually appealing Tkinter interface with a virtual keyboard for typing inputs.
